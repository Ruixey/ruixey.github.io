### Usecases for PurchaseTypes
The ModuleScripts in the PurchaseTypes folder (image below) are used to:
CurrencyCollectorConfig and PartCollectorConfig can be used in Essentials, Purchases and Purchased, everything else can just be used in Purchases and Purchased
1. CurrencyCollectorConfig is put directly into a part, this module is used to make a purchase a currency collector
2. DropperConfig is put into the purchase model, which need a part called "Drop" in it.
3. PartCollectorConfig needs to be directly in the part and collects drops.
4. UpgraderConfig needs to be in into the purchase model, it has a setting called "UpgraderPartName" which determates which part will be treated as an upgrader.
5. To make a conveyor work (can be used in Essentials, Purchased and Purchases) it needs to be named as set in Configuration and have an IntValue called "ConveyorSpeed" in it
6. The LeaderboardConfig is put into a Purchase, if you don't use the existing leaderboard, you need to write your own code to display the players the module
7. DropTeleportConfig is used to teleport Drops touching one part to another, you could use this to teleport parts into the collector on the 1st floor from the second one.
8. You can create custom PurchaseTypes and attach a Handler to them in the CustomFunctions module.

### How to make your own UI
You can read the EventWrapper, but do not change anything in it.
Everything else in the "TycoonkitUI" which is found inside kit>Content>Assets can be freely changed
Note that you have to recode the UIHandler once you changed the structure/names of the UI

![GUI](https://devforum-uploads.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/4X/a/3/1/a31485719e3446b83648708f0f672008eb7f4043.png)

### How to add Currencys
1. Open up the Configuration module
2. Scroll down until you see the Currencys category
3. Copy the line marked in the image below, rename "Money" to your new currency name and change the settings how you like them
4. Make sure to change the currency in every button to the new currency!

![Currencys](https://devforum-uploads.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/4X/9/b/6/9b638e4dac74d3df03a2362a5c56824ee04bcdc1.png)

5. Go into the Content>Assets>TycoonkitUI>CurrencyFrame and clone the Frame called "Money".
6. Rename the cloned Frame to the name of the Currency you want to display, and you're done.

![CurrencyDisplayFrames](https://devforum-uploads.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/4X/5/6/8/568ff210315b6deab3cb5f2a7346998ff95f0196.png)


### How to use Codes

![Codes](https://devforum-uploads.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/4X/7/a/a/7aa61bc14bd27befeb25b5accb1cdab03ebd2ec5.png)

1. Copy the marked snippet and paste it above
2. Remove the "--" infront of every line
3. Set "Code" to the word/phrase the player has to type in to redeem the set rewards
4. Write down every currency and the Amount they get in the "Reward" section (examples are Money and Bricks here)
5. If you have something like a CodeDropper, you can write it in the "PurchaseToSpawn" setting and it will insert the Purchase upon redeeming. Be aware that a Code can be entered at any time, so do not make a CodeDropper in the second floor cause it will then be in the Sky.
6. If you want your own code to run once upon redeeming, write it in the "RunFunction".
7. Codes can be redeemed only 1 Time per player, a CodeDropper stays there even after rebirthing.

### How to make a custom UI for Buttons (Version 1.3+)
1. In the Configuration Module, category "Buttons" set UseCustomButtonTag to true.
2. Copy the "TagUI" from _Ruixey's Tycoonkit **>** Content **>** Assets **>** TagUI_ or just make your own billboardGui
3. Put the billboardGui in each buttons "Head" part and customize it to your needs.
